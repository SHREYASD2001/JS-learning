// Variable RUles
// We cannot start variable with number. but we can declare number in variable. Also, we could use dollar or underline
//eg _firstname/$firstname
var num = 10;
console.log(num + 10);
//if we are using underscore while declarinf variable then it's snake case writing
// eg first_Name

//if we are not using underscore while declarinf variable then it's Camel case writing
//eg firstName

//LET keyword
let text = "Shreyas";
text = "Updated Name";
console.log(text);
//block scope vs function scope

//Const keyword
// sometimes some values are constant which never changes so we used this one
